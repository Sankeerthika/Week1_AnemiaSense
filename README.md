# 🩸 AnemiaSense – Week 1 Submission

## 📌 Project Overview
**AnemiaSense** is a machine learning-based system designed to detect anemia by analyzing key blood parameters such as Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and MCHC.  
The system aims to support early diagnosis and effective management of anemia using data-driven insights.

---

## 🎯 Week 1 Objectives
In Week 1, the focus was on:
- Collecting and loading the anemia dataset (`anemia.csv`)
- Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understanding relationships between parameters and anemia results
- Preparing data for model building in Week 2

---

## 🧠 Dataset Details
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Gender** | 1 = Male, 0 = Female |
| **Hemoglobin** | Hemoglobin level (g/dL) |
| **MCH** | Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin |
| **MCHC** | Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration |
| **MCV** | Mean Corpuscular Volume |
| **Result** | 1 = Anemic, 0 = Not Anemic |

## 📊 Work Completed
- Loaded dataset from Google Drive into Colab  
- Checked for missing values and data types  
- Generated summary statistics  
- Created visualizations:  
  - Distribution of Hemoglobin levels  
  - Class distribution of anemia results  
  - Correlation heatmap of features  

---

## 🧩 Next Steps (Week 2)
- Train multiple machine learning models for anemia prediction  
- Compare model accuracy  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
